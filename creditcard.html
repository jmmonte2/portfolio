        <b>About</b>
        <br>
        Java application that generates random credit card numbers that are validated
        by Luhn's algorithm. Each time a card is created they are stored in an SQLite database
        table.
        <br><br>
        
        
        <b>Motivation</b>
        <br>
        The reason I decided to work on this project was to gain an understanding of
        how Java applications communicate with databases, specifically, to learn how
        to store objects from an application into a database.

        <br><br>
        <b>Key Takeaways</b><br>
        <em>JDBC</em><br>
        Gained an understanding of how JDBC API is responsible for connecting Java applications to
        a database. In this project, I utilized the  SQLite JDBC driver, which was used to convert
        JDBC calls to a call that the database can understand.<br><br>
        <em>Closing Connection</em><br>
        Also learned that it is best practice to explicitly close the database connection after using it, 
        since a memory leakage can occur if left open and that could potentially lead to poor performance
        in application.<br><br>
        <em>SQL Statements</em><br>
        This project also taught me how to run SQL statements using the necessary library (java.sql.Statement) while
        also making use of exception handling (try-catch statements) to run the statements just 
        in case runtime errors occur.
